üîπ Correct Flow of Mobile Automation (Appium + Android SDK)
1Ô∏è‚É£ Appium Client Library (Test Scripts)
What it does: Contains test scripts written in Java, Python, etc.
How it works: Sends automation commands (like tap, swipe, type) to the Appium Server using WebDriver protocol.
When you write test scripts in Java, Python, etc., the client library converts them into WebDriver commands (HTTP requests).

2Ô∏è‚É£ Appium Server
What it does: Acts as a middleware between the test script and the mobile driver.
How it works: Receives WebDriver commands from the client and routes them to the appropriate mobile driver.
The Appium Server does not use WebDriver Protocol here.
Instead, it translates WebDriver commands into driver-specific API calls (e.g., UIAutomator2 API for Android, XCUITest API for iOS).

3Ô∏è‚É£ Mobile Driver (UIAutomator2, Espresso, XCUITest)
What it does: Translates Appium commands into Android-specific UI interactions.
How it works: Uses Android SDK tools (ADB) to send actions to the device (like clicking a button or fetching an element).

4Ô∏è‚É£ Android SDK (ADB, Platform Tools, Build Tools, etc.)
What it does: Provides core tools to communicate with Android devices.
How it works: ADB (Android Debug Bridge) executes shell commands, deploys apps, and transfers data between the driver and the device.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Android Device (Virtual Emulator / Real Phone)
What it does: Executes automation actions (tap, swipe, input, etc.).
How it works: Receives commands via ADB and performs UI interactions on the app.

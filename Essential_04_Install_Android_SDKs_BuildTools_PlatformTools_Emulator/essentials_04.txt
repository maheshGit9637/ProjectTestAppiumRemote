Essential_04_Install_Android_SDKs_BuildTools_PlatformTools_Emulator

This ensures that users know they must install:
✅ Android SDKs → Core development & debugging tools
✅ Build Tools → Required for compiling & building APKs
✅ Platform Tools → Includes ADB (Android Debug Bridge) for device communication
✅ Emulator → Virtual device for testing



Yes! ✅ **For mobile automation, you need to install only these three things:**  

1️⃣ **Android SDK** (Automatically includes essential tools)  
   - ✅ ADB (Android Debug Bridge) → Communicates with devices  
   - ✅ Platform-tools → Required for debugging & automation  
   - ✅ Build-tools → Required for compiling APKs  
   - ✅ Developer APIs → Helps in app development & testing  
while installing android SDK via Android studio make sure your path to install Sdk should not contain any space
path should be like - C:\Android

2️⃣ **Emulator (Android Virtual Device - AVD)**  
   - ✅ Provides a **virtual hardware environment** for testing  

3️⃣ **Android System Image**  
   - ✅ Provides the **Android OS** to run on the emulator  

Once these are installed, **you are ready for automation!** 🚀  
No extra setup is needed—**Appium will use ADB to communicate with the Emulator or a real device.**  

### 🔹 **Final Thought:**  
If you install Android SDK via **Android Studio**, it **automatically installs** everything needed (SDKs, Platform Tools, ADB, Emulator, System Images).  
If installing via **command line**, just ensure these three things are installed. ✅  

Now you're all set for mobile automation! 🚀 Let me know if you need any more details. 😃
